# Avatar Image Setup Guide

## Quick Steps to Add Your Avatar

Your About section is now set up to display a professional circular avatar. Here's how to add your actual photo:

### Option 1: Save Your Photo Directly (Recommended)
1. Save the photo you provided as: `assets/images/ianara-avatar.jpg`
2. The site will automatically display it in a circular frame with a green border

**File location:** `c:\Users\35387\Desktop\dataSite\dataSite-2\assets\images\ianara-avatar.jpg`

### Option 2: Use Avatar Generation (If no photo available)
Run this command:
```bash
python create_avatar.py
```
This creates a professional initials-based avatar (IF) with a gradient background.

### Option 3: Online Avatar Services
- Gravatar (www.gravatar.com) - Upload once, use everywhere
- Avatar generator tools for professional headshots
