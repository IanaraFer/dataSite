# üåê DOMAIN SETUP GUIDE - analyticacoreai.com

## üîç Current Situation Analysis

### Problem: analyticacoreai.com goes to wrong website
This happens because:
1. **Domain not purchased** - You might not own it yet
2. **DNS not configured** - Domain not pointing to your website
3. **Wrong hosting setup** - Files not uploaded to domain hosting

## üéØ SOLUTION 1: Check Domain Ownership

### Step 1: Verify You Own the Domain
- **Go to**: whois.net/analyticacoreai.com (opened for you)
- **Check**: If YOU are listed as the owner
- **If NOT owned**: You need to purchase it first

### Step 2: Where Did You Buy the Domain?
Common providers:
- **Namecheap**: Check namecheap.com account
- **GoDaddy**: Check godaddy.com account  
- **Google Domains**: Check domains.google.com
- **Other**: Check your email for purchase confirmation

## üöÄ SOLUTION 2: Connect Your Domain to Your Website

### If You Own the Domain:

#### Option A: Point Domain to Netlify (Easiest)
1. **Go to your domain provider** (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. **Find DNS settings**
3. **Add these records**:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: @ (or blank)
   Value: melodic-haupia-d8fe7c.netlify.app
   
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: melodic-haupia-d8fe7c.netlify.app
   ```
