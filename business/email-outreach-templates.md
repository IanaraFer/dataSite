## 🎯 **EMAIL TEMPLATE 2: FOLLOW-UP EMAIL**
*For companies that didn't respond to first email*

**Subject:** [Company Name] - Missing out on €45K/quarter? (Data insights)

Hi [Name],

I sent you a note last week about DataSight AI's impact on companies like [Company Name].

I understand you're busy, so I'll keep this brief:

**The average business loses €45,000 per quarter** from poor data-driven decisions. Most don't even realize it's happening.

**3 quick questions:**
1. Do you currently use your sales/customer data to predict future trends?
2. Can you identify your most profitable customer segments automatically?
3. Do you spot unusual business patterns before they become problems?

If you answered "no" to any of these, **DataSight AI could add €180,000+ to your annual revenue.**

**Not convinced?** Here's what RetailMax (similar to your business) achieved:
- 23% increase in customer lifetime value
- €180,000 additional revenue in first quarter
- 420% ROI in 6 months

**Want to see how this applies to [Company Name]?**

I can show you a 15-minute demo using data similar to yours. You'll see exactly what insights you're currently missing and how much they're worth.
