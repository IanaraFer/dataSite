# 🚨 CRITICAL BUILD FIX APPLIED - October 1, 2025

## ✅ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED & FIXED:**

### **Issue:** 
Netlify build failures were caused by **duplicate sections** in `netlify.toml` file:

❌ **Duplicate `[build.environment]` sections** (causing parser confusion)
❌ **Duplicate `[[redirects]]` sections** (creating conflicts)
❌ **Malformed TOML syntax** (breaking build process)

### **Root Cause:**
The `netlify.toml` file had multiple environment and redirect sections that violated TOML file format specifications, causing Netlify's build system to fail during the configuration parsing stage.

## 🔧 **FIXES APPLIED:**

1. **✅ Removed duplicate `[build.environment]` sections**
   - Consolidated to single environment section
   - Kept proper Node.js and Python versions

2. **✅ Removed duplicate `[[redirects]]` sections**  
   - Single redirect rule for SPA routing
   - Proper status codes and force settings

3. **✅ Cleaned up TOML syntax**
   - Proper section ordering
   - Valid configuration structure
   - Added security headers

4. **✅ Validated final structure:**
   ```toml
   [build] -> [build.environment] -> [build.processing] -> [[redirects]] -> [[headers]]
   ```

## 🚀 **EXPECTED RESULT:**

- ✅ Netlify builds should now **complete successfully**
- ✅ Site should deploy from `website/` directory 
- ✅ All forms, payments, and functionality restored
- ✅ Proper caching and optimization enabled
